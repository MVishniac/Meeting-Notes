# PREP meeting
## August 10, 2015
- Heavy use of online video
- Video tutorial
- Eclinic
  - Live video appointments
  - Online one on one between parent and volunteer via Skype
    - May also be expanded to email, text, etc (likelihood of law bandwidth of parents)
- Need to get the word out to meet criteria
- Still resources on the website itself
- Site launches September 30th
- San Diego, Minneapolis, NYC
 - Partnering with schools and YMCA
 - Exploring partnership with Big Brothers Big Sisters
- Levels of partnership
 - Getting the word out to members, providing childcare, etc
- NYC Dept. of Education kicked PREP out
 - Special Education department instigated
- Reaction is generally negative at first
 - Can't force way in
 - Must be careful with word choice when contacting the school district
- Organizers should use community contacts to make cities more interested in partnering with PREP
- Established partnership means we CANNOT sue a district on behalf of the parents
 - target organizations outside of the school district, who then may think it's a good idea for the school to partner with us
- Need to increase reach across the country
 - Some states won't have enough volunteers from that area
   - Need to focus on regions in the most populated states and cities
   - people may not be resposive to calls from outside the states
 - Create a hotline for volunteers to cet cases from
   - Non EP related hotline
- Can't just target specific communities and populations right off the bat
 - Must also aim for high-populated areas
 - Have to focus on the underserved community
- Areas where we have affiliates
 - Affiliates will be informed re: PREP as well
 - Don't focus on areas where we have affiliates
- Eclinic roll-out in January
- Connect with partner if they happen to bring up education
 - Don't worry yet about reaching out to education organizations in your states
 - Mention PREP when it's actually rolling out in email or meeting
   - Ask to distribute to membership, introductions to education orgs, etc
 - Right now, think of how to engage around this
- General information on the site right now (federal)
 - Will put up more specialized info if many people are in a certain area, etc
- Mostly cover: Navigating school system, school discipline, english languague learners, special ed
 - also reacting to local need (EX: Common Core)
- Not looking to go into a new city in person at the moment
 - Focus on online outreach in all new places
- Willingness to handle call from other states?
 - Nancy working on this with pro-bono firms
- Possibility of using call center model to keep volunteers from being nervous
- Send separate email or document saying where the strongest contacts are
 - Think as a team where your strongest contacts are
- Where do we have law firms?
 - I KNOW we don't have any firms in New Mexico and Ohio
 - Michigan contacts are not very strong at the moment
- Emily will send out updated outreach plan
 - Nancy and Natasha will send out the list of states with law firms
   - Use track changes to record contacts in states
