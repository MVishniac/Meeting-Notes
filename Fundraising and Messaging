- CRM needs new accounting system, reporting tools (one-stop reports, jet-reports, etc), grant management
 - Ensures better fiscal management in the future
- We have no adopted policy on reserves
 - Greg knows all the normal spending policy
-Current campaign was not well defined
 - Has hindered the ability to raise large amounts
- We have no elevator speech
 - We are lacking in certain necessities for messaging and organization of funds that mean we spend way more than we need to!
 - We need strategy
- We need better technological access and information management
 - Multiple  database issue
 - CiviCRM should fix this issue, but may require lots of work to set up correctly
