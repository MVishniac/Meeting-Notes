- bounce OVL guidelines off of Trevor before sending
 - send to Trevor
- need to talk to Marcia and Ezra to see if we can send out even though Jon "doesn't understand"
- need to have a presentation with Ezra, Marcia, and Jon to go over OVL and why data needs to be carefully watched and produced
 - Absolutely needs to be set up before the November election and Presidential Primaries
- MUST have a next step
- Set up a meeting with Ezra and Marcia to go over OVL in two weeks
 - The second meeting should introduce and talk about the data policy that we need and why we need it
- First meeting will be talking about what we're planning on discussing over the next several months and reintroduce them to OVL
- The Report Writing Process will need tweaks and changes after the TX report
- Ezra needs to learn how to actually edit
 - Can we get Maria to set up a general training but aim it at him?
- Jenny is setting up the OVL meeting
- YOUR next step is to wait and see how the second iteration of the report writing process goes
 - See if there are edits when Jenny and Megan are done
