# National Voter Registration Day call with Fiona (Bud Fed)
## August 14th, 2015

- Hotline was printed on the posters
 - Definitely need hotline during voting hours
- Should be less of an event than in 2014
- More accessible to non-English speakers
 - Spanish, Korean, Vietnamese, simplified Chinese
- More accessible to people with disabilities
- Hasn't talked to NALEO yet
- Has talked to APIA
 - Will be involved
 - Usually get voicemails that they respond to
 - Get calls leading up to NVRD as well
- Need to know when to close the hotline (west coast hours)
 - Most events are during the day
   - Hopefully fewer things going on in the evening
- Primaries aren't part of the main message of the day
- Loves the Brinly idea for the promo video
 - Would push that out on NVRD social media
- Would like social media things in the days leading up AND on NVRD
- Targeting registration in non-English communities
 - Communities of color, LGBT, lower economic status
