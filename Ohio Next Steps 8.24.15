# Ohio next steps
## August 24, 2015

- What is Catherine's idea of the next steps
 - Schedule a call for sometime this week
 - What does she need from us?
 - We have black churches contacts
   - We could find churches that are interested
 - Someone on the ground to do the presentations is a necessity
   - What kind of targeting are we looking at
 - Do we just give her the list of churches or does she want us to actually do much outreach?
Do we support Issue 1?
 - Jon doesn't want to weigh into this kind of thing, but Marcia thinks we should
   - Is this mission creep?
 - Need a conversation between Dorian, Jon, Marcia
